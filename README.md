### [Paper (FB-BEV)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02236) | [Paper (FB-OCC)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01492) | [Intro Video](https://youtu.be/KEn8oklzyvo?si=zydZjIwoTzTd-bsO)

FB-BEV and FB-OCC are a family of vision-centric 3D object detection and occupancy prediction methods based on forward-backward view transformation.

## News
- `[2023/8/01]` FB-BEV was accepted to ICCV 2023.
- üèÜ `[2023/6/16]` FB-OCC wins both Outstanding Champion and Innovation Award  in [Autonomous Driving Challenge](https://opendrivelab.com/AD23Challenge.html#Track3) in conjunction with CVPR 2023  End-to-End Autonomous Driving Workshop and  Vision-Centric Autonomous Driving Workshop.
